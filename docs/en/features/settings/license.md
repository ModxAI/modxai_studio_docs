## Free User Guidelines

### Quota System
Free users have monthly limits on:
- **Model Operations**: Number of loads/inferences.
- **Data Processing**: Number of dataset rows processed.
- **Training**: Number of checkpoints saved.

### Checking Quota
- Hover over the **Quota Indicator** in the top menu bar to see your remaining balance.

### Quota Exhaustion
When you run out of quota:
1. Features will show a "Quota Exceeded" warning.
2. You can wait for the next month's reset or upgrade to Pro.

### Network Requirement
> ⚠️ **Free users must remain online.**
- **Offline**: Features are disabled because quotas are managed server-side.
- **Unstable Network**: Operations may fail if the connection drops.

## Pro User Benefits

### Offline Usage

| Trial | 1 Day |
| Monthly | 10 Days |
| Quarterly | 30 Days |
| Yearly | 90 Days |
| Lifetime | 360 Days |

> 💡 **How Offline Time Works**:
> *   Every time you connect to the internet, the offline timer **resets**.
> *   *Example*: A Lifetime user connects today; they can now stay offline for 360 days.
> *   We recommend connecting periodically to keep your license fresh.

### Expiration
If your subscription expires:
1. You will be notified to renew.
2. The account automatically reverts to **Free User** status.
3. You retain access to your data but are subject to quotas.
